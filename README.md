**3D Raycast Pathfinding**

this 3d raycasting pathfinding is only good for space rts games where pathfinding is used ONCE on click, it finds a path and returns a list of waypoints (it does NOT work with ground, it finds a 3d path on all axis)

it first checks all directions (up and down too) to find a path and then calculates the shortest direct path
